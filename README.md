# ParaShelf
Parametric 3D shelf/bookcase generator

To compile:
1.) Ensure SolidPython and FreeCAD are installed
2.) Set your parameters in code and execute the program
3.) Open your generated files in FreeCAD
4.) Using the OpenSCAD Workbench, execute the "Refine Shape" proceedure
5.) Export the shape (I use .step files for importing into Fusion360)
6.) Open up your favorite CAM program and specify your cuts

Sorry for the poor code, this was kind of hacked together and this is the first time I've touched python in at least a decade.  This will (hopefully) improve in the near future.
